  caveats <<~EOS
    This release installs into ~/.local/lib/omp-code-mode and links
    ~/.local/bin/omp, so the existing current/previous pointers keep deciding
    which release is live. Ensure ~/.local/bin is on your PATH.

    The binaries are ad-hoc signed but not Developer ID-signed or notarized, so
    Gatekeeper still refuses a quarantined copy. The shipped installer removes
    com.apple.quarantine from the tree it installs; no --no-quarantine flag is
    used, and Homebrew no longer has one. Integrity comes from this Cask's
    pinned sha256 plus the per-file digests the installer re-verifies from
    release.json.
